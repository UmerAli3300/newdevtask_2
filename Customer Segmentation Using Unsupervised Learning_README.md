**Task 2: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning **


Objective 

Segment mall customers into distinct groups based on spending behavior and income level using K-Means clustering. The goal is to derive actionable marketing strategies tailored to each customer segment. 
Approach 

    Loaded and explored the Mall Customers dataset (200 records, 5 features).
    Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and relationships — particularly between Annual Income and Spending Score.
    Applied K-Means clustering to group customers. Optimal number of clusters (k=5) was determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
    Visualized clusters using scatter plots and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
    Analyzed cluster profiles to assign behavioral labels and propose targeted marketing actions.
     

Results and Findings 

    Five clear customer segments were identified: 
        High Income, Low Spending
        Medium Income, Medium Spending
        Low Income, High Spending
        High Income, High Spending
        Low Income, Low Spending
         

    PCA confirmed clusters remain well-separated even when including Age (85% variance retained). 

    Each segment responds differently to marketing stimuli — enabling personalized campaigns, inventory planning, and loyalty program design. 
     

Business Value 

This segmentation model allows the business to move from generic marketing to targeted, data-driven strategies — improving conversion rates, customer retention, and marketing ROI by focusing resources on the right audience with the right message.
